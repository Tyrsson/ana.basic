# Considerations

1. Request handling does not handle 404, 403, 500. It should.
2. Request currently does not detect nor distinguish ajax request. It should.
3. Renderer currently does not support rendering only the injected file if the request is ajax. It should.
4. Currently there has not been an App object created. The application is not really structured in any way. It should be.
5. If App was to be created it will not have a service layer so all service creation will be ad-hoc. Its better to address this issue early.
6. The application has no means of data persistence.
7. The application currently does not support session management of any kind. Its built dynamincally true, but it is still a static site in many aspects.
